# Programming

Hello! 

I'm a Physics grad student and I want to be a data scientist when I graduate.

In this repository, I put some mini data science projects I've done on my own for practice.
Most of them are from Kaggle, so you can find data there. 
You'll see the description of each project in the python notebook.
